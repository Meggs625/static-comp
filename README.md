## Abstract
  - This project was a challenge to see how well we could build to match a desktop comp as closely as possible, while still having some creative liberties. 

  - My wireframing of the different device sizes can be found [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l5Onets=/)

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS (including normalize.css)
  - node
  - VSCode
  - Miro (wireframing)

## Illustrations

  - Here is an image of the comp to match:

  - I decided to match everything as best as possible to the original as a personal challenge, but did want to add some of my favorite Monet paintings for the image backgrounds. This is how the desktop turned out:

  - With this challenge, I jumped into my first attempt at styling "mobile first" to ensure the look would style well on smaller screens.

  - After the mobile look was set, I utilized the responsive CSS grid format and media queries to ensure the look for iPad and laptop:

## Wins
  - I ended up having a lot of fun with this project. CSS is an area that I'm continuously working to improve, and this was a great opportunity to test my skills. 
  - As I mentioned above, this was my first attempt at styling the mobile view first and then adding responsive design for larger screens. I felt that this went well and enjoyed building in the responsiveness. 

## Challenges + Improvements
  - CSS is still akin to a petulant teenager for me. Although I did end up close to the look I was hoping for, there was a lot of trial and error involved. I would eventually like to get to the place where I utilize CSS with confidence. 
  - There are still some areas that I would like to get closer to pixel perfect: the color of the 'Personal Videos' icon and figuring out why a left-to-right scroll bar appears at a certain screen size.
